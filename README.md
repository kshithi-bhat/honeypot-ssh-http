# 🕵️‍♂️ Honeypy — SSH & WordPress Honeypot

Honeypy is a lightweight Python honeypot designed to simulate vulnerable endpoints and capture attacker behavior for learning and research purposes.

It currently provides:

- **SSH Honeypot** (fake shell, command logging, credential logging)  
- **WordPress Login Honeypot** (credential capture via Flask)  
- **Rotating logging system**  
- **Simple CLI to choose honeypot mode**

> ⚠️ Use only in controlled environments (VM / VPN lab). Do not expose publicly without proper isolation.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
pip install flask paramiko
Generate SSH host key (required once):

bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f server.key -N ""
🚀 Usage
Run SSH honeypot
Accept any credentials:

bash
Copy code
python honeypy.py --ssh -a 0.0.0.0 -p 2223
Require specific credentials:

bash
Copy code
python honeypy.py --ssh -a 0.0.0.0 -p 2223 -u admin -pw secret123
Run Web honeypot (Fake WordPress login)
bash
Copy code
python honeypy.py --http -a 0.0.0.0 -p 5000
Open in browser:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:5000
🔐 How to SSH into the Honeypot
From another machine / VM:

bash
Copy code
ssh -p 2223 testuser@<HONEYPOT_IP>
Testing locally:

bash
Copy code
ssh -p 2223 attacker@localhost
To suppress host-key prompts (optional):

bash
Copy code
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -p 2223 attacker@<HONEYPOT_IP>
Notes

Replace <HONEYPOT_IP> with the honeypot host IP (e.g., 192.168.56.101 or localhost).

Any credentials work unless you started the honeypot with -u and -pw.

After login you'll see the fake shell prompt:

ruby
Copy code
corporate-jumpbox2$
Supported commands: pwd, whoami, ls, cat jumpbox1.conf, exit. Other commands are echoed and logged.

📝 Logs
File	Description
audits.log	SSH login attempts (IP + username + password)
cmd_audits.log	Commands executed in the fake SSH shell
http_audits.log	Web login attempts & IPs

Logs are written with RotatingFileHandler (adjust maxBytes and backupCount in code if needed).

✅ Best Practices
Run in a VM or isolated host.

Do not expose to public internet without containment.

Protect or remove server.key before pushing to public repos.

Monitor logs and rotate/archive them regularly.
